## Inspiration
**EMPOWERING THE YOUTH**
Here at Painter Pals, we believe that the future is in the hands of the youth. By providing young, ambitious students a platform to enhance their learning experience in and out of the classroom, students will truly find the fun in learning. In the midst of a global pandemic, establishing connections between young minds is needed now more than ever.

## What it does
**THE ULTIMATE LEARNING EXPERIENCE**
Our Chalk N' Talk online chalkboard establishes a connection to a remote server, allowing quick and easy communications of thoughts and ideas via drawings! Need a sketchpad to calculate the mass of the sun? With friends? Chalk N' Talk has got you covered! With a wide variety of colors to choose from (5), a built in eraser, and a brush size slider, creativity will flow effortlessly!

## How we built it
**A PROGRAMMER'S PARADISE**
We built a server using Python alongside a graphical interface and client using Java Swing.
With the help of Git, Eclipse, and IntelliJ,  we were able to collaborate on code and build the chalkboard of our dreams! 

## Challenges we ran into
**A PROGRAMMER'S WORST NIGHTMARE**
1. One of our programmers operating system wouldn't handle our sick code. 
2. There were many debates as to how we would design the rendering system we would use to display our epic drawings.
3. Our schedules caused a handful of issues.
4. Our buttons were not appearing at the initial launch of the program.
5. Our eraser caused the most amount of problems. Our eraser draws a specific portion of the background image over what is already there. Capturing the correct portion of the background image gave rise to several issues.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
**THE DREAM TEAM**
We are more than happy to have completed our initial goal within the allotted time frame. Although there is much more to add, we are very proud of the outcome.

## What we learned
**YOU WIN SOME, YOU LOSE SOME**
Not everything is uphill when it comes to software development. Patience is a virtue. Compromising with your teammates and branching off of each other's ideas is key.

## What's next for Chalk N Talk
Voice channels, lobbies, text, menus, saving boards, and much more!
