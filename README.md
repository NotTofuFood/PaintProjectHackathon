## This project was created for high tech hacks.

## Inspiration
**EMPOWERING THE YOUTH**
Here at Painter Pals, we believe that the future is in the hands of the youth. By providing young, ambitious students a platform to enhance their learning experience in and out of the classroom, students will truly find the fun in learning. In the midst of a global pandemic, establishing connections between young minds is needed now more than ever.

## What it does
**THE ULTIMATE LEARNING EXPERIENCE**
Our Chalk N' Talk online chalkboard establishes a connection to a remote server, allowing quick and easy communications of thoughts and ideas via drawings! Need a sketchpad to calculate the mass of the sun? With friends? Chalk N' Talk has got you covered! With a wide variety of colors to choose from (5), a built in eraser, and a brush size slider, creativity will flow effortlessly!

## How we built it
**A PROGRAMMER'S PARADISE**
We built a server using Python alongside a graphical interface and client using Java Swing.
With the help of Git, Eclipse, and IntelliJ,  we were able to collaborate on code and build a muliti-device chalkboard.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
**THE DREAM TEAM**
We are more than happy to have completed our initial goal within the allotted time frame. Although there is much more to add, we are very proud of the outcome.

## What we learned
**YOU WIN SOME, YOU LOSE SOME**
Not everything is uphill when it comes to software development. Patience is a virtue. Compromising with your teammates and branching off of each other's ideas is key.

## What's next for Chalk N Talk
Voice channels, lobbies, text, menus, saving boards, and much more!
